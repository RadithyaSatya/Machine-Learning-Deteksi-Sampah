# AI-Powered Smart Recycling Assistant

## Team ID: CC25-SF059

### Description
This project is a machine learning-based computer vision system designed to detect and classify waste materials. Using deep learning techniques, the model analyzes images and determines the type of waste to facilitate proper recycling.

### Project Overview
- Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify waste types.
- Developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).
- Trained on a dataset containing various categories of waste (plastic, metal, paper, etc.).
- Aims to promote efficient waste sorting and recycling.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation.

### Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled waste images.
- Preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- The dataset should be placed in the `data/` directory.

### Model Training
- The model is trained using supervised learning.
- Optimized with hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy and confusion matrix analysis.

### Contribution
- Fork the repository and submit pull requests for improvements.
- Suggestions for enhancing model performance are welcome.
